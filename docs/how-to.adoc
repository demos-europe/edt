== How to add custom Drupal filter operators

The library provides the `PredefinedDrupalConditionFactory` class, which already supports multiple common operators.
To add additional operators, you can extend this class and add your operators to the arrays returned by
`getOperatorFunctionsWithValue` and `getOperatorFunctionsWithoutValue` respectively.

Alternatively, you can directly extend the parent interface `DrupalConditionFactoryInterface` with your own
implementation, circumventing the `PredefinedDrupalConditionFactory` implementation.

Make sure to provide your own implementation via constructor injection instead of `PredefinedDrupalConditionFactory`
to have it take effect.
