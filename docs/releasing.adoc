WARNING: Work in progress

This repository uses link:https://github.com/symplify/monorepo-builder[symplify/monorepo-builder] to
release several packages.

To create a new release, `bin/monorepo-builder release &lt;major|minor|patch&gt;` can be used after all changes have been done.

== Changelog management

The monorepo builder release flow kinda expects a `## Unreleased` headline to be at the top of the Changelog
but does not currently create a new one after a release. So please remember to manually add it after releases.
