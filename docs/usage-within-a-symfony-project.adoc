WARNING: Work in progress

While using EDT is in no way limited to https://symfony.com/[Symfony] projects, it was developed with such background and thus its documentation (for now) focuses on this use case.

== Services

Most of the logic is implemented in classes that can be defined as singleton Symfony services. You can define such
services as needed.

== Handling requests

To cover the five different kinds of requests defined in the https://jsonapi.org/format/1.0/[JSON:API specification], EDT provides five corresponding classes in the `EDT\JsonApi\Requests` namespace, that can be defined as Symfony services.

[source,php]
----
use EDT\JsonApi\Requests\ListRequest;
use EDT\JsonApi\Requests\CreationRequest;
use EDT\JsonApi\Requests\DeletionRequest;
use EDT\JsonApi\Requests\GetRequest;
use EDT\JsonApi\Requests\UpdateRequest;
